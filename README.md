With full-stack experience in banking software and big-data, real-time analytics software and a number of smaller personal projects, I have solid experience of what working with different types of good and bad software is like on both a macro and micro scale across the full stack, and why it's important. Also being from a heavy maths background, algorithms and cunning, original solutions to difficult problems are what set me apart from other developers.

Self-teacher. Original solutions.
