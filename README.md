#About me

With experience in banking software and big-data, real-time analytics software and a number of personal projects, I have solid experience of working with different types of software in different programming languages on both a macro and micro scale across the full stack and software lifecycle. I have worked with plenty of well designed and badly designed software so have a thorough appreciation of the importance of good software design and the trade-offs between complexity, time constraints and future maintenance/enhancements. Also being from a heavy maths background, algorithms and cunning solutions to difficult problems are one of my specialties.
