"About me"
With full-stack experience in banking software and big-data, real-time analytics software and a number of personal projects, I have solid experience of working with different types of well-designed and badly-designed software on both a macro and micro scale across the full stack, so have a thorough appreciation of the importance of good software design and an appreciation of the trade-offs between complexity, time constraints and future maintenance/enhancements. Also being from a heavy maths background, algorithms and cunning solutions to difficult problems are what set me apart from other developers.
